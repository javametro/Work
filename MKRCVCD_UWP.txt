issues:

1, tool can't found the MKRCVCDSER.exe after recovery. It maybe some difference between preload system & recovery system.

try to use another api?

2, Lucky found that 64GB above usb can't made ok.
	-- the reason was the services poped up a message box, so it can not interact with user.
	-- blocked the tool.
