issues:

1, tool can't found the MKRCVCDSER.exe after recovery. It maybe some difference between preload system & recovery system.
	--> solved at L6AAL71512(MKRCVCD-UWP)

try to use another api?

2, Lucky found that 64GB above usb can't made ok.
	-- the reason was the services poped up a message box, so it can not interact with user.
	-- blocked the tool.
	-- solved at L6AAL61510 (mkrcvd dp) module
	
3, L6AAL71410 (mkrcvcd uwp) can't pinned to StartMenu. Roll back to L6AAL71310 for Lucky & maisy. 
	-- L6AAL71310 preload ok to mkrcvcd, but it need update progressbar at tool start step.
	--> solved at L6AAL71512(MKRCVCD-UWP)
	
4, partition tool appx can't start after cbd recovery.(Aqua Core preload)
